								<br><br>
								<h2 id="desc">Metallurgy is defined as a process that is used for the extraction of metals in their pure form. The compounds of metals mixed with soil, limestone, sand, and rocks are known as minerals. Metals are commercially extracted from minerals at low cost and minimum effort. These minerals are known as ores. A substance which is added to the charge in the furnace to remove the gangue (impurities) is known as flux. Metallurgy deals with the process of purification of metals and the formation of alloys.</h2>

								<h2 id="desc"> The various processes involved in extracting metals from their ores and refining them for use are referred to as metallurgy.<br><br>
								The following are the various steps in the metal extraction or metallurgical process:<br><br>
								<ul style="padding-left: 25px;">
									<li>Crushing and grinding the ore.</li>
									<li>The concentration of ore, is also known as ore enrichment.</li>

							<div id="extract">
								<h1 id="titles">Extraction</h1>
								<br><br>
								<h2 id="desc"> Extractive metallurgy is the practice of removing valuable metals from an ore and refining the extracted raw metals into a purer form. In order to convert a metal oxide or sulphide to a purer metal, the ore must be reduced physically, chemically, or electrolytically. Extractive metallurgists are interested in three primary streams: feed, concentrate (metal oxide/sulphide) and tailings (waste).

								After mining, large pieces of the ore feed are broken through crushing or grinding in order to obtain particles small enough, where each particle is either mostly valuable or mostly waste. Concentrating the particles of value in a form supporting separation enables the desired metal to be removed from waste products.<br>
								<img id="pics" style="width:700px; height: auto; margin-top: 10px;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Yuan_Dynasty_-_waterwheels_and_smelting.png"><br>
								Mining may not be necessary, if the ore body and physical environment are conducive to leaching. Leaching dissolves minerals in an ore body and results in an enriched solution. The solution is collected and processed to extract valuable metals. Ore bodies often contain more than one valuable metal.
								Tailings of a previous process may be used as a feed in another process to extract a secondary product from the original ore. Additionally, a concentrate may contain more than one valuable metal. That concentrate would then be processed to separate the valuable metals into individual constituents.</h2>

								<h1 id="titles">Metal and its Alloys</h1>
								<br><br>
								<h2 id="desc">Much effort has been placed on understanding iron–carbon alloy system, which includes steels and cast irons. Plain carbon steels (those that contain essentially only carbon as an alloying element) are used in low-cost, high-strength applications, where neither weight nor corrosion are a major concern. Cast irons, including ductile iron, are also part of the iron-carbon system. Iron-Manganese-Chromium alloys (Hadfield-type steels) are also used in non-magnetic applications such as directional drilling.<br><br>

									<h2 id="irondesc"> Iron, the most common metal used in metallurgy, is shown in different forms (cube, chips and nuggets) </h2>
								</div>
								<br>
								Other common engineering metals include aluminium, chromium, copper, magnesium, nickel, titanium, zinc, and silicon. These metals are most often used as alloys with the noted exception of silicon, as it is not a metal.<br><br>
								<ul>
									<li>Stainless steel, particularly Austenitic stainless steels, galvanized steel, nickel alloys, titanium alloys, or occasionally copper alloys are used, where resistance to corrosion is important.</li>
									<li>Aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys are commonly used, when a lightweight strong part is required such as in automotive and aerospace applications.</li>
									<li>Copper-nickel alloys (such as Monel) are used in highly corrosive environments and for non-magnetic applications.</li>
									<li>Nickel-based superalloys like Inconel are used in high-temperature applications such as gas turbines, turbochargers, pressure vessels, and heat exchangers.</li>
									<li>For extremely high temperatures, single crystal alloys are used to minimize creep. In modern electronics, high purity single crystal silicon is essential for metal-oxide-silicon transistors (MOS) and integrated circuits.</li>

				<h2 id="desc">  Small amounts of natural gold have been found in Spanish caves dating to the late Paleolithic period, 40,000 BC. Silver, copper, tin and meteoric iron can also be found in native form, allowing a limited amount of metalworking in early cultures. Certain metals, notably tin, lead, and at a higher temperature, copper, can be recovered from their ores by simply heating the rocks in a fire or blast furnace, a process known as smelting. The first evidence of this extractive metallurgy, dating from the 5th and 6th millennia BC, has been found at archaeological sites in Majdanpek, Jarmovac and Pločnik, in present-day Serbia. To date, the earliest evidence of copper smelting is found at the Belovode site near Pločnik. This site produced a copper axe from 5,500 BC, belonging to the Vinča culture. Copper smelting is also documented at this site at about the same time period (soon after 6,000 BC), although the use of lead seems to precede copper smelting. Early metallurgy is also documented at the nearby site of Tell Maghzaliyah, which seems to be dated even earlier, and completely lacks that pottery.[citation needed] The Balkans were the site of major Neolithic cultures, including Butmir, Vinča, Varna, Karanovo, and Hamangia.</h2>

				<h2 id="desc">In the Near East, about 3,500 BC, it was discovered that by combining copper and tin, a superior metal could be made, an alloy called bronze. This represented a major technological shift known as the Bronze Age.

		The extraction of iron from its ore into a workable metal is much more difficult than for copper or tin. The process appears to have been invented by the Hittites in about 1200 BC, beginning the Iron Age. The secret of extracting and working iron was a key factor in the success of the Philistines.

		Historical developments in ferrous metallurgy can be found in a wide variety of past cultures and civilizations. This includes the ancient and medieval kingdoms and empires of the Middle East and Near East, ancient Iran, ancient Egypt, ancient Nubia, and Anatolia (Turkey), Ancient Nok, Carthage, the Greeks and Romans of ancient Europe, medieval Europe, ancient and medieval China, ancient and medieval India, ancient and medieval Japan, amongst others. Many applications, practices, and devices associated or involved in metallurgy were established in ancient China, such as the innovation of the blast furnace, cast iron, hydraulic-powered trip hammers, and double acting piston bellows.

		A 16th century book by Georg Agricola called De re metallica describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores, metal extraction and metallurgy of the time. Agricola has been described as the "father of metallurgy".</h2>

				<h1 id="titles"> Metallurgy Contribution towards GDP </h1>
				<br><br>
				<h2 id="desc">The rise in population, growth in the economy, urbanization and the increasing domestic requirements, has created a strong demand for minerals and metals. In the last few years, India has seen significant growth in minerals with the government granting leases for longer durations of 20 to 30 years.

The Mining Sector’s contribution to GDP is US$ 21.86 billion. In Fiscal Year 2016 (FY16), India had 1,878 operative mines. For global players, India is a big market for mineral resources, as metals and power demand is expected to have robust growth in the long term. India ranked 4th globally in terms of iron ore production and was the 3rd largest producer of crude steel in the Asia-Pacific region in 2015. In FY16, production was expected to reach 140 million tonnes of iron ore. India was 3rd in total and the finished steel production (alloy + non-alloy) in India was estimated to reach 90 million tonnes in FY16.

Currently, aluminum is the 2nd most used metal in the world after steel and the 3rd most available element in the earth, constituting almost 7.3 % by mass. At present, aluminum is the fastest-growing non-ferrous metal and its production volume falls second to the demand for steel. Domestically, the demand and consumption of aluminum was projected to rise to about 3 million tonnes by 2017 from nearly 1.71 million tonnes now. Also, copper stands 3rd in consumption after steel and aluminum. India is also among the top five zinc mining countries globally.</h2>
